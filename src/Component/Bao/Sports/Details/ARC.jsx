                <h2>What is Archery?</h2>
                Archery is one of the oldest sports still practised, and is
                closely linked to the development of civilisation. Using bows
                and arrows, the sport as a history dating back thousands of
                years. As a cultural advance, it was comparable to the discovery
                of fire and the invention of the wheel.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>By whom, where and when was Archery invented?</h2>
                Archery was the favourite sport of the Egyptian pharaohs during
                the 18th dynasty (1567-1320 BC). Many centuries later, some of
                the earliest recorded archery tournaments took place during the
                Zhou dynasty (1046 - 256 BC) in China. Such events were attended
                by Chinese nobility. Much later, English writers honoured the
                longbow for famous contributions to their country's victories in
                the battles of Cr√©cy, Agincourt and Poitiers.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 1200 BC, the Hittites and Assyrians shot their bows from
                chariots, becoming fearsome opponents in battle. They made their
                bows with tendon, horn and wood, and also developed a new
                re-curved shape. This made their bows shorter and more powerful,
                making them easier to handle for an archer on horseback.
