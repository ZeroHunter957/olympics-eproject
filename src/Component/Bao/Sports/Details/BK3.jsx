                <h2>What is 3x3 Basketball?</h2>
                3x3 basketball is an exciting, urban and innovative variation of
                basketball played with three players on each team on a
                half-court setup with one hoop and backboard. It is widely held
                to be the world's number one urban team sport.

                <h2>By whom, where and when was 3x3 Basketball invented?</h2>
                3x3 basketball was developed as a creative variation of
                traditional full-court basketball.
                <br />
                <br />
                The sport has its origins in the urban areas of the United
                States of America in the late 1980s where the condensed form of
                basketball was often practiced in backyards and parks before
                eventually evolving into a cultural phenomenon.
                <br />
                <br />
                Following its soaring popularity FIBA later developed 3x3 as the
                second basketball discipline to attract a new audience and
                provide more opportunities for its member associations and
                players worldwide. It was structured into a professional sport
                with official rules sanctioned by FIBA.
