                <h2>What is Handball?</h2>
                Handball is a fast-paced indoor game where opposing teams try to
                score by throwing a ball into a football-style goal with posts
                and a crossbar.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>By whom, where and when was Handball invented?</h2>
                Handball was first played towards the end of the 19th century in
                Scandinavia and Germany. 'Field handball' - an 11-a-side game
                played outdoors - was first recognised at the turn of the
                century, and G. Wallstr√∂m introduced indoor handball to Sweden
                in 1910.
                <br />
                <br />
                Between 1938 and 1966, both forms of handball were played at
                separate World Championships with indoor handball gaining
                pre-eminence.
