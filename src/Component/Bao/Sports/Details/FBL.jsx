                <h2>What is Football?</h2>
                Football is the most popular sport in the world and sees
                opposing teams of 11 players try to score goals primarily by use
                of the feet.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>By whom, where and when was Football invented?</h2>
                Football has its roots in ancient China while the modern version
                of the game began on the streets of medieval England.
                Neighbouring towns would play each other in games where a
                heaving mass of players would struggle to drag a pigâ€™s bladder
                by any means possible to markers at either end of town.
                <br />
                <br />
                English football's governing body, the Football Association,
                codified the laws of the game in 1863.
