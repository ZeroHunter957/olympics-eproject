                <h2>What is Cycling BMX Freestyle?</h2>
                In BMX Freestyle, riders perform routines consisting of
                sequences of tricks carried out on flat ground, in the streets,
                on dirt jumps, a halfpipe and/or on constructed ramps. In
                competition, riders are judged on the quality of their
                performance.

                  By whom, where and when was CYCLING BMX FREESTYLE invented?
                </h2>
                Bicycle Motocross (BMX) Freestyle quickly developed as a
                separate discipline from BMX Racing following its start in the
                1960s in California.

                <br />
                From 1980 until 1987, BMX Freestyle increased in popularity. The
                disciplineâ€™s founding governing body was first called the
                Amateur Skate Park Association (ASPA) in 1982, and then a couple
                years after, it changed to the American Freestyle Association
                (AFA). Eventually, the discipline became governed by the Union
                Cycliste Internationale (UCI).
