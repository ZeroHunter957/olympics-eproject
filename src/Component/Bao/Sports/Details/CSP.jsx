                <h2>What is Canoe Sprint?</h2>
                Canoe sprint sees competitors race each other on a flatwater
                course over distances between 200 and 1000 metres.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are two types of boats: canoes, where the athlete is
                strapped into the boat in a kneeling position using a
                single-blade paddle, and kayaks with the athletes seated and
                employing a double-bladed paddle.
                <br />
                <br />
                The majority of races are between individuals plus there are
                also two-person canoe and four-person kayak classes in the
                Olympic Games.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>By whom, where and when was CANOE SPRINT invented?</h2>
                Having studied the kayak - the Inuit word for "man boat" -
                British explorer and travel writer John MacGregor is credited
                with transforming the traditional hunting and fishing boats into
                sporting vessels and founded the Royal Canoe Club in 1866.
                <br />
                <br />
                Canoe sprint, originally known as flatwater canoe, is the
                original and simplest form of the sport where an athlete wins by
                reaching the finish first.
