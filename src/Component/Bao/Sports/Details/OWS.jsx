                <h2>What is Marathon Swimming?</h2>
                Marathon swimming sees athletes take on a 10km course in open
                water environments such as the sea, rivers and lakes - meaning
                it is as much a test of mental strength and tactical ability, as
                it is physical endurance.
                <br />
                <br />
                The open environment means that athletes must adjust to changing
                currents, while physical contact between competitors and water
                stops are a regular occurance.
                <br />
                <br />
                After approximately two hours of racing there is an exciting
                sprint finish in the final three kilometres.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>By whom, where and when was Marathon Swimming invented?</h2>
                The concept of marathon swimming has been around since Captain
                Matthew Webb became the first person to swim across the English
                Channel in 1875. Another notable marathon swim took place in
                1926, when 19-year-old Gertrude Ederlee became the first woman
                to make the crossing between England and France.
