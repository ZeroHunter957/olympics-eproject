                <h2>What is Badminton?</h2>
                Badminton is a racket-and-shuttle game played on a court by two
                players or doubles teams. The sport takes its name from
                Badminton House—home of the Duke of Beaufort in the English
                county of Gloucestershire.

                <h2>By whom, where and when was Badminton invented?</h2>
                In 1873, the Duke is credited with bringing a version of the
                game—Poona—back from India and introducing it to his guests.
                <br />
                <br />
                The sport quickly grew in popularity, and in 1877, the first set
                of written rules were devised by the newly formed Bath Badminton
                Club. The Badminton Federation of England was created 16 years
                later, and in 1899, it organised the first All England
                Championships.Badminton is a racket-and-shuttle game played on a
