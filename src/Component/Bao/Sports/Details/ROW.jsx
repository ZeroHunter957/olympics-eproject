                <h2>What is Rowing?</h2>
                Rowing involves propelling a boat using oars fixed to the
                vessel. It differs from other disciplines in that rowers sit
                with their backs to the direction of movement, therefore
                crossing the finish line backwards.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the Olympics, rowers race against each other as individuals
                or in crews of two, four or eight.

                <h2>By whom, where and when was Rowing invented?</h2>
                Rowing was first used as a means of transport in ancient Egypt,
                Greece and Rome. As a sport, it probably began in England in the
                17th and early 18th centuries, with the Oxford-Cambridge
                university boat race in the United Kingdom, which was
                inaugurated in 1828.
