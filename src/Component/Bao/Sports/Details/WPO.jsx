                <h2>What is Water Polo?</h2>
                Water polo is a sport played in water between two teams of seven
                players, including one goalkeeper, all wearing matching coloured
                caps.
                <br />
                <br />
                Players attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the
                opposing team's goal, and the team with the most goals at the
                end of the game wins the match.
                <br />
                <br />
                The sport is typically played in a 3m deep pool measuring 30,6m
                by 20m for men and 25,6m by 20m for women, so that players
                cannot touch the bottom.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>By whom, where and when was Water Polo invented?</h2>
                Water polo is a tough sport, but when it first began, it was
                even tougher. It is said that the game originated from Great
                Britain, where people played rugby in rivers and lakes in the
                mid-19th Century. Fighting between players was common, if not
                the norm.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 1897, New Yorker Harold Reeder formulated the first American
                rules for discipline, which were aimed at curbing the sport's
                more violent tendencies.
