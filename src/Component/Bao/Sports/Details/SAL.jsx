                <h2>What is Sailing?</h2>
                Formerly the world's major form of long-distance trade and
                transport, sailing - the art of moving a boat or similar vessel
                by harnessing the waves and the wind - is now largely a sporting
                pursuit.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>By whom, where and when was Sailing invented?</h2>
                Sailing has for thousands of years been a form of transport used
                in activities from exploration to fishing and even warfare.

                International yacht racing began in 1851, when a syndicate of
                members of the New York Yacht Club built a 101-foot schooner
                named "America". The yacht was sailed to England, where it won a
                trophy called the Hundred Guineas Cup in a race around the Isle
                of Wight. The trophy was renamed "The America's Cup" and it
                remains yachting's most coveted prize as well as the world's
                oldest international sporting competition.
