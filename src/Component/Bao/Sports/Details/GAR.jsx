                <h2>What is Artistic Gymnastics?</h2>
                Introduced in 1894, artistic gymnastics was one of the original
                disciplines in the modern Olympic Games. Artistic gymnasts are
                challenged to perfect their skills across a range of equipment,
                such as the beam and performing on the floor.

                <h2>
                  By whom, where and when was Artistic Gymnastics invented?
                </h2>
                Plato, Aristotle, and Homer heartily advocated the strengthening
                qualities of gymnastic activity. The Ancient Greek civilisation
                more than two thousand years ago believed symmetry between the
                mind and body was possible only when physical exercise was
                coupled with intellectual activity.
                <br />
                <br />
                The term "artistic gymnastics" emerged in the early 1800s to
                distinguish free-flowing styles from techniques used in military
                training. Gymnastic competitions began to flourish in schools
                and athletic clubs across Europe, and made a fitting return at
                the first edition of the modern Olympic Games were revived in
                Athens in 1896.
