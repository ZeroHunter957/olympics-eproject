                <h2>What is Rhythmic Gymnastics?</h2>
                Olympic rhythmic gymnastics is a female-only event that uses
                apparatus to showcase skill, flexibility and musicality, and
                made its Olympic debut in Los Angeles for the 1984 Games. There
                are just two categories: individual all-around women and group
                all-around women. Find out everything you need to know about the
                sport in this video guide to rhythmic gymnastics.

                  By whom, where and when was Rhythmic Gymnastics invented?
                </h2>
                Rhythmic gymnastics originated in Europe during the 19th century
                and has since evolved into an Olympic sport.
                <br />
                <br />
                The credit for inventing rhythmic gymnastics goes to the Swedish
                educator Per Henrik Ling, who developed a system of exercises.
                Ling's system focused on the harmonious combination of physical
                movement and music, which laid the foundation for the
                development of rhythmic gymnastics.
